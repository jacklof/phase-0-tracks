/*
Define a function that finds the longest string in an array of strings
  Input: an array of strings
  Steps:
    - Create a string var to be returned that it is equal to the value of the of the given array's first index
    - Iterate through a for loop, starting with an index value of 1 and ending with index of array's length - 1
      - If the given array's value at the current index is longer than the return string, set the return string to that value
      - Otherwise, move on to the next index
  Output: the longest string of the given array
