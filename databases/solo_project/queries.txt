1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

> SELECT * FROM cars;

1|Honda|Pilot|7|true
2|Honda|Civic|2|false
3|Nissan|Frontier|4|true
4|Porsche|Boxster|8|true
5|Dodge|Viper|3|false

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

> UPDATE cars SET is_working="true" WHERE id=2;

1|Honda|Pilot|7|true
2|Honda|Civic|2|true
3|Nissan|Frontier|4|true
4|Porsche|Boxster|8|true
5|Dodge|Viper|3|false

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

> SELECT * FROM cars, colors WHERE cars.color_id = colors.id;

1|Honda|Pilot|7|true|7|black
2|Honda|Civic|2|true|2|green
3|Nissan|Frontier|4|true|4|yellow
4|Porsche|Boxster|8|true|8|purple
5|Dodge|Viper|3|false|3|blue

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

> SELECT cars.make, cars.model, colors.name, cars.is_working FROM cars JOIN colors ON cars.color_id = colors.id;

Honda|Pilot|black|true
Honda|Civic|green|true
Nissan|Frontier|yellow|true
Porsche|Boxster|purple|true
Dodge|Viper|blue|false

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

> DELETE FROM cars WHERE id=4;

1|Honda|Pilot|7|true
2|Honda|Civic|2|true
3|Nissan|Frontier|4|true
5|Dodge|Viper|3|false

| -=: Different JOIN queries :=- |
+--------------------------------+
There are a few different basic types of JOINs. They are INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL. There are more, but these are the basic ones. I was looking and I can't quite figure out how to make the correct queries for my own tables. Here are some attempts...

> SELECT make, model, color_id, is_working FROM cars INNER JOIN colors ON cars.color_id = colors.id;

Honda|Pilot|7|true
Honda|Civic|2|true
Nissan|Frontier|4|true
Dodge|Viper|3|false

> SELECT make, model, color_id, is_working FROM cars LEFT JOIN colors ON cars.color_id = colors.id;

Honda|Pilot|7|true
Honda|Civic|2|true
Nissan|Frontier|4|true
Dodge|Viper|3|false

I don't know, these all produce the same results so I am obviously doing something wrong. Hopefully this will become more evident as I ask others.
