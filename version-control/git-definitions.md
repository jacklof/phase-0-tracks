* Version control is a way of keeping track of backup versions of a project. It is useful so that you can keep track of who has done what and so that you can revert mistakes.
* A branch is an object that contains alternate versions of a repository. You would use one to organize changes made.
* A commit is a savepoint for a change. A good commit message accurately describes what has been changed.
* A merge conflict "is a computer problem where multiple editors cannot all edit the same item during a short time period," according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_conflict).
