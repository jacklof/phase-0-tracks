*In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?*

A VPS is like renting a space on another computer to act like a dedicated server. Instead of having to set up and maintain your own server, you can utilize a space of someone else's, usually for cheaper. There is no set up involved other than uploading your files.

*Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?*

It's considered bad because you can damage the OS a lot easier. Running as root could allow any bug in a program to wreak havoc. Nothing prevents you from doing stupid things by accident, and there is no security.
