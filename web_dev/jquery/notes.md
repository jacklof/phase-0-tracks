*Effective strategies?*

Some effective strategies to studying is to find code examples, as well as looking at StackOverflow questions. Not trying to learn everything at once, and bookmarking links helps as well. It's easy to get overwhelmed at the sheer volume of resources out there, but I picked a few I thought would be particularly useful. Overall, I've learned what the basic idea of it is, and have gathered enough information to be able to implement it on a basic level. I believe practice over time will make this easier.

*Look up what jQuery is exactly*

jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

Here is the list of important core features supported by jQuery −
* DOM manipulation − The jQuery made it easy to select DOM elements, traverse them and modifying their content by using cross-browser open source selector engine called Sizzle.
* Event handling − The jQuery offers an elegant way to capture a wide variety of events, such as a user clicking on a link, without the need to clutter the HTML code itself with event handlers.
* AJAX Support − The jQuery helps you a lot to develop a responsive and feature-rich site using AJAX technology.
* Animations − The jQuery comes with plenty of built-in animation effects which you can use in your websites.
* Lightweight − The jQuery is very lightweight library - about 19KB in size ( Minified and gzipped ).
* Cross Browser Support − The jQuery has cross-browser support, and works well in IE 6.0+, FF 2.0+, Safari 3.0+, Chrome and Opera 9.0+
* Latest Technology − The jQuery supports CSS3 selectors and basic XPath syntax.
