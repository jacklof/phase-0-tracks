<!-- 
The purpose of semantic tags is to more easily categorize content using intuitive nomenclature. I see <header> <footer> <main> and <nav> to be the most useful since those are used everywhere, I'd imagine.

The order the browser uses is top to bottom, so whichever elements are nearest the top of the file will be loaded first.

I learned that you can create shortcuts outside of the built-in ones. Eventually I think I will create some, but for now I want to practice typing everything so it becomes committed to memory.

The snippet itself was most challenging, although not particularly. It took a bit to figure out the spacing, however.
